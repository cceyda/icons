# Collection Method

This is just some stuff I have accumulated over time.
They are usually copied from related official websites. And converted from various formats to PNG (can't use svg with in google slides)
They may vary in scale size so resize as needed.

This is not a completely comprehensive list.
Some companies have multiple versions of their icons light/dark, icon w/o name etc, some don't.

# FYI
I don't own any of these logos, they belong to whoever owns them.
Follow fair non-commercial use.
aka don't sue me, If you don't want your icon/logo here open an issue and I will remove.
If you want your icon here open a PR
